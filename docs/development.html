      <h3>App Concept</h3>
      <p>
        A combined sleep-tracking and alarm app that provides sleep insights and supports waking up reliably.
        The core differentiator is puzzle-based alarm dismissal to reduce oversleeping and improve alertness.
      </p>

      <h3>Use Case</h3>
      <p>
        Users set one or multiple alarms, track their sleep during the night, and review reports to understand sleep
        duration and quality.
        In the morning, the alarm can include a puzzle challenge to ensure the user is fully awake before turning it
        off.
      </p>

      <h3>Target User</h3>
      <p>
        Snorly is mainly designed for students and busy people who often oversleep, struggle with waking up on time,
        and want a simple way to improve sleep habits with clear insights and routines.
