        PRIVACY POLICY
        Last Updated: January 21, 2026

        Snorly is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle your information.

        1. SIMPLE PRIVACY PRINCIPLE
        Snorly is a "Local-First" application. This means that your personal data, including sleep records and alarm settings, stays on your device. We do not have a server, and we do not see your data.

        2. HEALTH CONNECT DATA (IMPORTANT)
        Snorly requests access to your sleep data via Android Health Connect.
        - Usage: We read your sleep sessions to provide Insights, Weekly Trends, and Consistency Scores.
        - Limited Use: Snorly's use of information received from Health Connect will adhere to the Health Connect Permissions policy, including the Limited Use requirements.
        - Storage: This data is processed locally on your device. We do not upload this data to any external servers.

        3. DATA SAFETY & THIRD PARTIES
        - No Selling: We do not sell, trade, or rent your health or personal data to third parties, advertisers, or data brokers.
        - No Analytics: We do not use third-party tracking or analytics inside the app.

        4. YOUR RIGHTS (GDPR / CCPA)
        As the data never leaves your device, you have full control:
        - Access & Deletion: You can delete your data at any time by clearing the app's storage or by deleting the app.
        - Revoking Access: You can revoke Snorly's access to Health Connect via your Android System Settings at any time.

        1. PURPOSE OF SERVICE
        Snorly is an alarm clock and sleep tracking tool intended for personal use. While we strive for accuracy, the app is provided "as is."

        2. MEDICAL DISCLAIMER
        Snorly is NOT a medical device. The sleep insights and "medical feedback" provided are for informational purposes only. They should not be used to diagnose or treat any medical condition. Always consult a healthcare professional for medical advice.

        3. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
        We are not responsible for any consequences resulting from the failure of the application, including:
        - Alarms failing to sound due to system restrictions or battery optimization.

        - Any indirect damages (e.g., being late for appointments).

        4. DATA OWNERSHIP
        You own your data. As Snorly is a local-first app, we do not store your data on our servers. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device.
